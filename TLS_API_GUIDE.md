# TLS/SSL API - Fixed for Vercel Timeouts

## What Was Wrong

### Before
- SSL Labs analysis takes **60-120 seconds** for a full scan
- API was polling up to 6 times with 4-second delays = 24+ seconds
- Vercel Hobby plan has a **10-second timeout**
- Result: **504 Gateway Timeout** error
- Error response was HTML, not JSON, causing parsing errors

### The Error You Saw
```
"Unexpected token 'A', 'An error o'..." 
```
This was Vercel's HTML error page starting with "An error occurred..."

## How It Works Now

### Smart Caching Strategy

The API now uses a **cache-first approach**:

```
1. Check SSL Labs Cache (fast, < 1 second)
   ├─ READY? → Return results immediately ✅
   ├─ IN_PROGRESS? → Tell user to wait and retry 🔄
   └─ NO_CACHE? → Start new scan, tell user to retry ⏱️

2. Never wait/poll (prevents timeout)
3. User retries after 1-2 minutes to get results
```

### Response Types

#### ✅ Success (Cached Results)
```json
{
  "status": "READY",
  "endpoints": [...],
  "host": "example.com",
  // ... full SSL Labs data
}
```

#### 🔄 Pending (Scan In Progress)
```json
{
  "status": "PENDING",
  "message": "SSL Labs is analyzing this domain. Please try again in a moment.",
  "host": "example.com",
  "statusDetails": "Analysis in progress"
}
```

#### ⏱️ First Time Scan
```json
{
  "status": "PENDING",
  "message": "SSL Labs scan initiated. Please try again in 1-2 minutes.",
  "host": "example.com",
  "hint": "SSL Labs performs a comprehensive analysis which takes time."
}
```

#### ❌ Error
```json
{
  "error": "Failed to fetch TLS data",
  "message": "Specific error details",
  "host": "example.com",
  "suggestion": "Try again or check if domain is accessible"
}
```

## User Experience

### First Request
User runs: `/tls example.com`

**If domain was never scanned or cache is old:**
```
Response: "SSL Labs scan initiated. Please try again in 1-2 minutes."
Action: API triggers background scan (fire-and-forget)
```

### Second Request (1-2 minutes later)
User runs: `/tls example.com` again

**If scan is still running:**
```
Response: "SSL Labs is analyzing this domain. Please try again in a moment."
```

**If scan completed:**
```
Response: Full SSL Labs analysis with grades, vulnerabilities, etc.
```

### Subsequent Requests
**SSL Labs caches results for 24 hours**, so future requests are instant! ⚡

## Technical Details

### Timeout Handling
- **Request timeout**: 8 seconds (under 10s limit)
- **No polling**: Prevents cumulative timeout
- **AbortController**: Properly cancels long requests
- **JSON responses**: Always returns valid JSON, even for errors

### SSL Labs API Parameters
- `fromCache=on`: Check cache first
- `all=done`: Only return completed scans
- `startNew=on`: Trigger new scan (fire-and-forget)

### Error Handling
```typescript
try {
  // Try to fetch with timeout
} catch (AbortError) {
  // Return timeout message
} catch (Error) {
  // Return error message
}
```

## Testing

### Test Locally
```bash
# First request (should trigger scan)
curl "http://localhost:5173/api/tls?host=example.com"

# Response: PENDING

# Wait 1-2 minutes, then retry
curl "http://localhost:5173/api/tls?host=example.com"

# Response: Full results
```

### Test on Vercel
```bash
# First request
curl "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/tls?host=example.com"

# Check logs
vercel logs --since 10m
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Popular Domain (Already Cached)
```
Request: /tls google.com
Response: Immediate results ✅
Why: Google is scanned frequently, cache is fresh
```

### Scenario 2: Your Domain (First Scan)
```
Request 1: /tls mydomain.com
Response: "Please try again in 1-2 minutes" 🔄

[Wait 90 seconds]

Request 2: /tls mydomain.com
Response: Full results ✅
```

### Scenario 3: Invalid Domain
```
Request: /tls invalid.domain.xyz
Response: SSL Labs error (domain doesn't exist) ❌
```

### Scenario 4: SSL Labs Under Load
```
Request: /tls example.com
Response: "Please try again in a moment" 🔄
Why: SSL Labs API is slow/busy
```

## Comparison with Other Tools

| Tool | Speed | Depth | Timeout Issues |
|------|-------|-------|----------------|
| **SSL Labs** | Slow (60-120s) | Deep analysis | Fixed with cache-first |
| Qualys SSL Test | Slow (60-90s) | Very deep | Would have same issue |
| SSL Checker | Fast (5-10s) | Basic | Would work |
| testssl.sh | Medium (20-40s) | Deep | Would timeout |

**Why we use SSL Labs:**
- Industry standard
- Most comprehensive
- Free API
- Trusted by security professionals
- **Cache makes it fast for repeated checks**

## Troubleshooting

### "Please try again in 1-2 minutes"

**This is normal!** SSL Labs needs time to:
1. Connect to your server
2. Test all SSL/TLS protocols
3. Check for vulnerabilities
4. Generate comprehensive report
5. Cache results

**Solution:** Wait and retry. Second request will be instant.

### Still Getting Timeout

**Unlikely**, but if it happens:

1. **Check SSL Labs Status**
   - Visit: https://www.ssllabs.com/
   - See if service is operational

2. **Check Domain Accessibility**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://yourdomain.com
   ```

3. **Check Vercel Logs**
   ```bash
   vercel logs --since 10m
   ```

4. **Use Alternative**
   - Try: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/
   - Manual scan, then cache will be available

### Error: "SSL Labs API returned 429"

**Rate limited!** SSL Labs limits:
- Max 1 scan per domain per minute
- Max 25 scans per hour from one IP

**Solution:** Wait 60 seconds and retry.

## Improvements Made

✅ **No More 504 Timeouts** - Returns within 8 seconds  
✅ **Always Valid JSON** - No more parsing errors  
✅ **Better Error Messages** - Clear, actionable guidance  
✅ **Smart Caching** - Uses SSL Labs 24-hour cache  
✅ **Fire-and-Forget Scans** - Triggers scan without waiting  
✅ **User-Friendly Flow** - Clear instructions to retry  

## Alternative: Get Results Faster

If you need instant results without waiting:

### Option 1: Pre-scan Domains
Run scans manually before users test:
```bash
# Pre-scan your domains
curl "https://api.ssllabs.com/api/v3/analyze?host=yourdomain.com&startNew=on"
```

### Option 2: Use Different Service
For instant results, consider:
- **Mozilla Observatory** - Fast, good for headers
- **SecurityHeaders.com** - Very fast, focused on headers
- **SSLMate** - Faster but less detailed

### Option 3: Run Your Own Scanner
- **testssl.sh** - Command-line tool
- **sslyze** - Python library
- Requires your own infrastructure

## Best Practices

1. **First Scan** - Let users know it takes time
2. **Show Progress** - Display "Analysis in progress" message
3. **Cache Results** - Store in localStorage to avoid re-scanning
4. **Batch Scans** - Scan multiple domains during off-peak hours
5. **Monitor** - Track which domains are scanned most

## Summary

The TLS API now works reliably within Vercel's timeout limits by:
- Checking cache first (fast)
- Never polling/waiting (prevents timeout)
- Returning helpful PENDING status
- Triggering background scans
- Letting users retry for results

**Result:** No more 504 errors, always valid JSON responses! 🎉
